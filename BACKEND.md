# Vai Back-End Code-Challenge

Goal: Create an image uploading service.

Requirements:

- Description and Owner attributes can be free flowing text fields.
- Metadata should be stored in a database.
- Image "files" should not be stored in the Database.
- Upload should respond with a unique URL of a page that will show the image and associated metadata
- This process should be repeatable (i.e., multiple images should be uploadable, each with own metadata and each with it's own unique URL)

Bonus points for (optional):
- Hosting a working copy of your app on Heroku
- Including tests/specs with your submission
