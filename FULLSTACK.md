#Vai Full-Stack Code Challenge

Goal: Build an image uploading service.

Requirements:
- Ruby on Rails as the back-end API;
- React or React Native as front-end;
- Must upload an image and know (at least) the image's upload date, a description, and the owner of the image;
- Description and Owner attributes can be free flowing text fields;
- Metadata should be stored in a database;
- Image "files" should not be stored in the Database;
- Upload should respond with a unique URL of a page that will show the image and associated metadata;
- This process should be repeatable (i.e., multiple images should be uploadable, each with own metadata and each with it's own unique URL);

Bonus points for (optional):
- Hosting a working copy of your app on Heroku;
- Including tests/specs with your submission;

Please submit your submission as a public git repository only, and send us the link to this repository for the email people@vai.car. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
