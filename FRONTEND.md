# VAI Frontend UI Developer

At VAI we work with modern web experiences optimized for mobile and desktop; solving the 21st century challanges for the automotive industry at big cities and empowering people to work and run their own business.

## Overview

For this test you are going to build a Proof Of Concept application with the technologies of your choice. The app is going to fetch data from [randomuser.com](https://randomuser.me).

To complete this challenge, you will need to write a scalable [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) web app or [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) mobile app, and provide us with the source files to be built.

## Background 

<name> is a human resources manager for a small bussiness that only employs Lego people. As part of the onboarding process, the company wants to ask all new Lego employees to create a company profile with their basic information so that <name> can have easy access to employee data and monitor the company's human resources from an HR dashboard. Some examples of how she will use these profiles in the future are: know when it's someone's birthday, see everyone's role in the company and what department they belong to, take notes on performance reviews, etc). Although it will take some time to build all of this functionality, for the MVP, <name> has asked for the basics. (Ability to create, view, and edit user profiles).

### Requirements

Create a List and Detail View for a set of Users Profiles, use this [API resource](https://randomuser.me/documentation) to generate and fetch mock data for users. 
  
- [ ] it should use React or React Native
- [ ] it should display a language picker and change the language as documented on [Random Users Nationalities](https://randomuser.me/documentation#nationalities). This will translate the users' information.
- [ ] it should have private(s) and public(s) page(s)/screen(s)
- [ ] A login page to give access to restricted area 
- [ ] If the user is logged in, the home page should display the dashboard (list view of user profiles) 
- [ ] it should display a list of users as documented at https://randomuser.me/documentation#pagination
- [ ] it should display each item as a card with basic information
- [ ] when I click on a card, it should navigate to the user details and show all the information in the API response.
- [ ] it should allow you to edit the user's information
- [ ] it should allow you to delete a user


### Bonus points
- [ ] Implement code splitting using react-loadable
- [ ] Use [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) to develop your components
- [ ] Test your components with Jest.

## Expected

### UI Design

We do not provide a sketch file or prototype, we'll look for basic UI/UX abilities.

## The Challenge

We'll be looking for **simple, well-designed and tested code** in the submission.

Please include a `README` with setup instructions, and any tests or other documentation you created as part of your solution.

Also, add the following info to your `README`:

* How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
* Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
* What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

## Details

Use your creativity to design the pages/screens in the best way you like. Also, you can use any global store like Redux or Mobx if you need it.
